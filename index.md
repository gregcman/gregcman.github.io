## Projects

- [sucle](https://github.com/gregcman/sucle)
  - an infinite voxel editor and walking simulator in lisp. I made it because it was fun to create intricate shapes and shapes that stretch on for hundreds of thousands of miles in real life units, and then use it as a platformer. uses model-view-controller, flood fill, convolutions, vector algebra, frustum culling.

- [crud](https://github.com/gregcman/sucle/tree/master/src/crud)
  - A persistent key-value storage for lisp objects. Uses either sqlite or a directory, when sqlite and transactions turned on can be fast.

- [voxel-chunks](https://github.com/gregcman/sucle/blob/master/src/sucle/voxel-chunks.lisp)
  - A tiered cache system for voxels. layer 1 is an array that can pin memory, layer 2 is a most recently used cache mru, layer 3 is the disk.
- [aabbcc](https://github.com/gregcman/sucle/blob/master/src/aabbcc/aabbcc.lisp)
  - 3d rasterization of lines, geometric algebra for a simple 3d collision system
- notes
  - I took a lot of notes over the years but they were scattered everywhere because I didn't know what I was doing. This system cleans up notes from google docs, google keep, samsung notes, evernote, apple notes, and custom locations and dumps a giant file sorted by time. This file was then fed to gpt2 which created an eerie charicature likeness of me. Obviously this system is private.
- [sucle-serialize](https://github.com/gregcman/sucle/tree/master/src/sucle-serialize)
  - Like python's [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html), it is an object serializer and deserializer for Common Lisp. 
- [sucle-multiprocessing](https://github.com/gregcman/sucle/tree/master/src/sucle-multiprocessing)
  - unity like job system, because there were no good lisp job processing systems available.
- [opengl](https://github.com/gregcman/sucle/tree/master/src/opengl)
  - implementation of the basic opengl functions and a thin layer that provides compatibility across glsl versions and opengl versions. Similar in spirit to ANGLE, but I havent checked the benchmarks.

- [project-euler](https://github.com/gregcman/project-euler)
  - solving math problems in lisp, and python
- [text-subsystem](https://github.com/gregcman/sucle/tree/master/src/text-subsystem)
  - similar to alacritty, the gpu terminal emulator. Very dense data transfer to the gpu, each character is just 4 bytes, rather than the naive polygon with texture and color which is 4 vertices/2 texture coordinates each and 2 colors each 4*((4 bytes * 2) + (4 bytes * 3 * 2)) = 128 bytes
- [a-sound-system](https://github.com/gregcman/a-sound-system)
  - audio playing library that uses ffmpeg, or libsndfile, and openal
- [cl-cfs-scheduler](https://github.com/gregcman/cl-cfs-scheduler)
  - a simple implementation of completely fair scheduling, an algorithm used in the linux kernel to schedule processes by priority.

- [cl-telegram](https://github.com/gregcman/cl-telegram)
  - use the telegram web api to poll for updates and send messages. API generated by parsing the telegram documentation in html.
- [wfc](https://github.com/gregcman/sucle/blob/wfc/src/sucle/wfc.lisp)
  - a contstraint solving system, which is a simple implementation of the [wavefunction collapse algorithm](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse) for texture synthesis in lisp. Extremely slow for voxels.

### Languages and Compilers
- [lisp in small pieces](https://github.com/gregcman/lisp-in-small-pieces) [Fork]
  - A Scheme compiler and bytecode interpreter
- [ridikulisp](https://github.com/gregcman/ridikulisp)
  - A very tiny turing complete language which is easy to extend and implement, it is not a turing tarpit. Inspired by LISP and [bitbitjump](https://esolangs.org/wiki/BitBitJump).
- [cl-c-parse](https://github.com/gregcman/cl-c-parse)
  - prototype of a c parser in common lisp, that is generated from lex and yacc specifications. It is  correct, but very slow.
- [llvm-for-cl](https://github.com/gregcman/llvm-for-cl)
  - basic compiler from s-expressions to assembly using llvm
- [lem](https://github.com/cxxxr/lem)
  - find some minor bugs and fix, such as scrolling and job processing. Also implement an [interactive frontend](https://github.com/gregcman/sucle/tree/master/src/lem-opengl) that allows dragging to resize windows, double and triple clicking, and dragging and dropping files. Also created a [simplified version](https://github.com/gregcman/minilem) in the spirit of [microemacs](https://github.com/torvalds/uemacs).
- [cl-nbt](https://github.com/pull-request-perhaps/cl-nbt) [Fork]
  - add system to deal with .mca files and make the algorithm simpler and more general.

- lisp is not economically or socially viable, but its the most rapid prototyping language available, and is useful if you enjoy programming itself or have a unique problem at hand with limited computing power.

languages and compilers
LISP is the essence of unbridled individualism.
I, being an american, was raised on rugged individualism. Thus, LISP appeals to me and it saddens me that this cherished art is dying.

It pains me to say that Individualism is overrated. Individualism does not scale. The bigger your operation, the more it converges on the hard sciences and leaves little room for self expression.
